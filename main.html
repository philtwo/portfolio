            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Philip! I’m a software developer with a great interest in technology. From gaming and computers to 
                understanding the inner workings of software, my journey into tech has been driven by curiosity and the desire to 
                build things that make an impact.<br>
                <br>
                I’m excited by the endless possibilities in tech, and enjoy developing software, creating 
                games, working with firmware, and building web applications. My goal is to be a versatile 
                developer with a wide range of skills, always learning and adapting to new challenges.<br>
                <br>          
                What drives me is the opportunity to craft unique, memorable experiences while 
                constantly evolving my work to stay fresh and relevant. I believe in learning through doing, 
                and I’m always eager to tackle challenges that push me to grow as both a developer and a 
                problem solver.<br>
                <br>
                Outside of tech, I’m a competitive gamer, an anime fan, and someone who loves to solder 
                and cook. I've spent a good portion of my life as a line cook, working with some of the best 
                people I’ve ever met; those experiences have shaped me into who I am today.<br>
                <br>
                I’m excited to continue growing as a developer and explore where this journey takes me, embracing new opportunities as they come.<br>
